# Adaptive Thermodynamic Cycle for Waste Heat Recovery

### Introduction

The program utilises the REFPROP library to model a thermodynamic Rankine cycle. The aim of the project is to investigate the effectiveness of an adaptive Rankine cycle using a mixture of zeotropic fluids that would be suitable for waste heat recovery.

### Functions File

This file compiles the calculations for the cycle into a callable function.
