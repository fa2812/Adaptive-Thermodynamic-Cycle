# About the Project

This repository includes the code used for an undergraduate individual research project titled "Adaptive Thermodynamic Cycle for Waste Heat Recovery" at the University of Southampton. The code is written in Python 3 and utilises the REFPROP library to model a thermodynamic Rankine cycle.

The aim of the project is to investigate the effectiveness of an adaptive Rankine cycle using a mixture of zeotropic fluids that would be suitable for waste heat recovery.

### Pre-requisites

The user should own a copy of the REFPROP 10 library to run the model. The following Python libraries should be installed:

* ctREFPROP
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* mpl_toolkits
* pandas
* pynverse

### Jupyter Notebook

The best way to view and run the code is through the Jupyter Notebook file as it provides the best visualisation for the code, analysis methods, and results.
